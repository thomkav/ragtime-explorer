/**
 * The daily allowance, which the page spends and never showed.
 *
 * Two limits sit under every turn and only one of them was on the screen. The conversation
 * cap (25¢) is in the `cost` event and the Meter renders it. The daily allowance is not:
 * the worker counts model calls per address per UTC day (`IP_DAILY_MODEL_CALLS`) and
 * refuses past it, so the first thing a member learned about the limit was being refused.
 *
 * Behind a mount that holds the credential, the address the worker counts is **the
 * mount's**, not the reader's. Everyone the gate admits therefore draws down one pool
 * between them, which is the opposite of what a page that says nothing implies. That is
 * the fact this module exists to put on the screen, and it is why the wording differs by
 * mount rather than being one sentence for both: on the page's own model the allowance is
 * the visitor's network, and telling them it is "shared" would be false.
 *
 * Pure, so `node --test` covers the wording; the component is thin over it.
