/**
 * Pointing at something on the page and saying what is wrong with it.
 *
 * The Explorer sits behind a member gate on a tenant that already runs a feedback spine,
 * so a note has somewhere honest to go: one POST to the tenant's capture route, filed
 * against the engagement's own feedback, triaged by a person. It is not a message to the
 * model and it does not join the conversation — a reader telling us the trail is confusing
 * is not a turn, and answering it with an answer would be the wrong shape entirely.
 *
 * The address is named at build time (`POINT_URL` in `config.ts`) and empty by default,
 * which is the page's own model: a page nobody mounted behind a gate has nowhere to send a
 * note and offers no way to write one. Recordbench's copy of this file is the same seam
 * from a different framework (`frontend/src/lib/point.ts` there); the wire contract they
 * share is the route's own docstring, `app/lawfare/api/feedback.py`.
